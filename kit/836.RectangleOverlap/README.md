# [836. Rectangle Overlap](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/)

## 2019/05/12

### 题目 💗[easy]

A rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of its top-right corner.

一个矩形,由`[x1, y1, x2, y2]`表示,你懂的🐶.

---

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

两个矩形重叠部分区域面积为正,返回`treu`否则`false`.

---

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.
