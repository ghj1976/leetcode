### 题目 💗[easy]

Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

冬天来了! 你首要工作是设计一个一般的供暖来解决周围暖气问题.

---

Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.

现在,你被给定大于 0 个供暖源, 找出最小半径来给整个房屋供暖

---

So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.

所以. 你将会输入正数数组的供暖源和被供暖点, 并且你期待输出最小半径.

Note:

注意

---

Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.

给定的数组数字大于零,小于 25000,
