Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

给一个二叉树, 你需要输出这个二叉树中第二小的数字.

---

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

如果没有返回-1

```bash

Example 1:

Input:
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
 

Example 2:

Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2

Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
