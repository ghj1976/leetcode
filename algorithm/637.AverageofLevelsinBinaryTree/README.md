### 题目 💗[easy]

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

给定一个非空二叉树,返回这个树每一层的平均值

Example 1:

例子 1:

---

```bash
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
```

Explanation:

解释

---

The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].

这个节点平均值 3, 14.5, 11

Note:

注意:

---

The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

这个节点的值的范围 32 比特整数内, `[-2^31, 2^31]`
