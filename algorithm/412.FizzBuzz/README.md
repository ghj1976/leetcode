写一个程序输出字符串集合,

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

但是当他是 5 的倍数,输出`Fizz`,5 的倍数输出`Buzz`,同时是 3 和 5 的倍数,输出`FizzBuzz”`

Example:

```go
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
```
