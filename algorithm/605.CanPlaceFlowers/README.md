Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

假设你有一个长花圃,其中某些地方种花,某些地方则不是.然而,花不能相邻,否则他们会死亡.

---

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

给定一个花圃(就是数组由 01 构成,0 是空,1 是 🌹),并且还有一个 n 数字, 要返回的结果是, 还能不能再再里面种 n 朵 🌹.
