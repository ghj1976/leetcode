# [872. Leaf-Similar Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/)

## 2019/05/28

### 题目 💗[easy]

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree. From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

考虑全部的二叉树子节点. 从左到右 输出这个队列. 就是先序遍历

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

Note:

Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
所有给定的二叉树最多1-100个节点.
