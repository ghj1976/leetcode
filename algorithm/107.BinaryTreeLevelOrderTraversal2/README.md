# [107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](\https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/)

## 2019/05/19

### 题目 💗[easy]

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

给定二叉树, 返回每一层组成的二维数组.

---

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

```bash
 3
/ \
 9 20
/ \
 15 7
```

return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

```js
[[15, 7], [9, 20], [3]];
```
