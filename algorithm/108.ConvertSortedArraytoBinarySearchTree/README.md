### 题目 💗[easy]

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

给定一个已排序数组,将它转化成平衡二叉树

---

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

对于这个问题.一个高度平衡的二叉树被定义成一个二叉树.它的每一个根节点的深度相差不超过 1.

Example:

例如:

---

> Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
>
> One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
>
> ```bash
>      0
>     / \
>   -3   9
>   /   /
> -10  5
> ```
